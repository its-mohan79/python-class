#OPERATORS IN PYTHON
 
#Following are some common operators in python: 

#1. Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, / etc. 
#2. Assignment operators:  =, +=, -= etc. 
#3. Comparison operators: ==, >, >=, <,  != etc. 
#4. Logical operators: and, or, not.

# 1 arithmetic operators

a=5 

b=6

print(a+b)      # a and b are the operands and the sign of +* etce are the operator and the value of equal is known as a result

# 2 assignment operators

c= 45  # here = is assignment operator which assigns value of 45 to variable c
c += 5  # this means c=c+5 here += is assignment operator it means the value of c is increament by 5
print(c)


# comparison operator
d= 5==5  # here == is comparison operator which 
#compares the value of a and b if both are equal it returns true otherwise false
print(d)
# logical operator
bool1= 1
bool2= 2
print( bool1 and bool2) # here and is logical operator if both the values are true it returns true otherwise false
print( bool1 or bool2)  # here or is logical operator if any one of the value is true it returns true otherwise false
print( not bool2)       # here not is logical operator it reverses the value if the value is true it returns false and vice versa
